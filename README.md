# CPS-dataset
A partial subset of the Cell Phone Shell (CPS) Dataset, which is applied in the work "Automated Shell Abrasion Detection for Cell Phone based on GraphFPN with Learnable Sparse Priors" (IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, under review)

# Contents
This repository contains:
* Training set and validation set
<!-- * Corresponding annotation JSON files with two annotation formats: <br>
 	* the coco format: `annotation_coco.json` <br>
 	* the VIA format (generated by VGG Image Annotator): `via_region_data.json` -->
* License Agreement: `CPS Dataset License Agreement`

# License and Statement
* It should be noted that due to the research needs, we are still increasing the number of images in the raw CPS dataset, so we cannot provide all the image data and annotations at one time. If you need more images, please email a scanned sign copy of `CPS Dataset License Agreement` to `guoxinrong2021@email.szu.edu.cn` or `xiaofangyan0611@gmail.com` and state clearly the application reason. We will give you feedback within 10 working days after receiving your email application.
* If you use our CPS dataset, please cite our paper "[Automated Shell Abrasion Detection for Cell Phone based on GraphFPN with Learnable Sparse Priors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9709343)" (IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, accepted)
